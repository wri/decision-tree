We know the neighborhood. We have already restored compartment numbers 67, 66, 65, and 64. Compartments numbers 69, 74, and 75 are congruent. The reconnaissance has involved taking note of the climate (temperature and rainfall distribution), soil, topography, waterflows, vegetation characteristics, and the sociology of the communities. These have guided the choice of tree species selection for the project.

2.	Community Engagement: Sakam Savana in collaboration with the community leaders and the partners — the traditional leaders, district, regional, and national agencies of the government— will engage the community in early January 2024, just before the project starts, to introduce the restoration initiative.  The core objective of the engagement is to foster deeper understanding and cooperation between Sakam Savana and the host communities. Sakam Savana will reiterate the desire to co-live for and co-govern and co-share and co-benefit from the project. Sakam Savana will invite the community to design together schemes of governance for various communal-benefit intervention schemes that engender good spirit for the community and the forest restoration.  

3.	Nursery: Nursery comes a bit early. Seed collection starts in anticipation of the future. Seeds collection and nursery preparations may have to start once announcement is made.  The active nursery commences mid January.

4.	Preparation of the planting site: Site preparation will start in January 2024 to usher the community members’ labour to enable them gain income. Site preparation means removing competing vegetation from the site and creating conditions that will enable the soil to catch and absorb as much rainfall as possible. Site preparation includes an application of organic manure. Manure application assists the seedlings for rapid growth and supports the farmers who will be offered land to get better yield.

5.	Fire belt: Fire-ride will be constructed in 14 days from March 1, 2024 – March 14, 2024

6.	Planting of seedlings processes. Planting starts around mid May 2024, when the rains start, for six weeks ending on June15, 2024.

Here's a breakdown:

Soil Preparation and Seed Planting (1st March to 1st April 2024):
During this period, our team will focus on soil preparation, which involves tasks such as soil sieving to remove debris and ensure optimal soil texture for plant growth.
Additionally, we'll be potting the soil into avocado seeds and planting them in suitable containers or directly in the prepared soil.
The goal here is to initiate the germination process and provide the young seedlings with the necessary environment to establish their root systems.

Grafting and Gestation Period (After 1st April 2024):
Following the initial planting phase, our attention will shift towards grafting the seedlings. Grafting is a horticultural technique where tissues from one plant are inserted into those of another so that they will unite and grow as one plant.
After grafting, we'll enter a gestation period where the grafted seedlings will need time to develop and strengthen. This period typically spans around three months, during which we'll monitor the progress of the plants closely.

Plantation Preparation (From November 2024):
As we approach November 2024, assuming the gestation period proceeds as expected, our focus will shift to preparing the seedlings for plantation.
This preparation includes ensuring that the seedlings are adequately hardened off and ready for transplantation into the field.
However, the timing of plantation will largely depend on the confirmation of sufficient rainfall. Avocado trees require a consistent water supply, particularly during their early stages of growth. Therefore, we'll wait for rain confirmation to ensure the optimal conditions for successful transplantation.

From January 2025- Mass mobilization of farmers and planting of avocado seedlings, for the first 6 months all plantation will be done. From June to December 2025, we are monitoring the seedlings survival rate and replacing the dead seedlings.
From Jan 2025-2029- Seedlings monitoring , husbandry and tree feeding programs adopted. After 3 year in planting- Harvesting of the first fruits and linking to export market.",approved,

1.	The project seeks to yield both ecological and economic dividends, with a dual focus on enhancing biodiversity and boosting farmers' income by restoring 2,000 hectares.
Key stages of implementation-
Stage 1- Beneficiary selection for practicing NPM and updating baseline and Site profiling- For the main objective of our proposed project is reviving the deteriorating fertility status of the farmlands, it is pertinent to identify farmers and farms that will be focused and acted on. This will enable the mapping and demarcation of 2000 hectares under restoration to track and ensure implementation. This will help to ensure full compliance and outputs and help with the record-keeping. This will probably be done by August 2024.
Stage 2- Capacity building of the farmers to build climate resilient farms- Once the farms are selected, capacity building of the farmers/beneficiaries becomes the next requisite. In order to build climate resilient farms that are more ecologically positive, trainings and technical hand-holding on soil health management practices as well as biological, cultural and nature positive methods of pest, disease and weed management are to be given. The importance of diversification, crop rotation, intercropping and plantations as well as allied activities shall be focused and disseminated.  This will be done throughout the cropping season as and when needed. For the next 6 months, it will be starting by August- September for the upcoming rabi season. 
Stage 3- Soil testing and planning to design Package of Practices for NPM (POP)- As we will be working on soil health, its crucial to measure the OC of the soil samples to take as a baseline and then planning to make a POP particular to crops under NPM covering all protocols like seed germination, seed treatment, seed rate and spacing, use of organic manures and cultures etc. that will ensure to reduce the cost of cultivation and increase the farmer’s income as well as improve the soil health over time. This will be executed in the month of September-October before the onset of the rabi cropping. 
Stage 4- Support for inputs to promote NPM agriculture- Starting from seed availability of different crops to promote seed diversification to ensuring availability of bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides in subsidized rates from BRCs will help reduce the cost of cultivation for these farmers and thus increase their household income. This will again be done throughout the crop season. The rabi crop usually is sown from November to February/March. 


2.Through ecological diversification, it introduces a variety of crops and farming techniques to bolster ecosystems' resilience to climate fluctuations, thus equipping farmers with more adaptive tools and planting 20,000 trees.
Key stages of implementation-
Stage 1- Trials and Demonstrations-  Through trails of different crops, the suitable varieties and crops are selected and then demonstrated to be adopted by the farmers. We plan on doing the same in the upcoming season including trails of mustard, coriander, lentil and vegetables. All of these being rabi crops will be planted between November-February. 
Stage 2- Provision of seeds- Based on the success of the trials, seeds will be provided to the farmers of different crops promoting diversification and resilience to climate fluctuations. 
Stage 3- Technical hand-holding with the package of practices- To help with the farming techniques, package of practices will be designed and implemented for every crop to ensure better agricultural practices that help equipping farmers for climate resilient farming. This will be done throughout the planting season with the small and marginal farmers identified. 
Stage 4- Land use planning – As an adaptive tool, land use planning is an approach that helps the farmer use his land in an efficient manner to get maximum income out of it. In this approach, fruit trees are planted in a small piece of land to help create an additional source of income for the farmers. This will be done from July-august where tree saplings will be distributed to farmers for planting. 
Stage 5- Site selection for planting trees- For the plantation of trees, site selection will be the first step and identifying whether  it is forest land or revenue land and planning for the plantation accordingly. This should be taken up from July- August 
Stage 6- Identification of ‘van samitis’ and mobilizing them for plantation- On site selection and identification, in forest land plantation can only be done with the ‘van samitis’. So, the next step will be mobilizing and promoting them to plant trees. This should be done by July-August this year. 
Stage 7- Plantation, fencing and watering- Upon mobilizing the ‘van samitis’, digging of the pits will be followed by plantation and thereafter the trees will be fenced and watered through the year by the people of the ‘van samitis’. 


3.It tackles soil erosion and optimizes water retention by employing methods like building check dams and improving drainage lines.
Key stages of implementation-
Stage 1- Site selection- The first step of implementing soil and moisture conservation work is to select the site where it is required 
Stage 2- Designing and planning of the structures- After selection, there will be planning for the structures and designing them to adapt the topography
Stage 3- Technical Sanction and Administrative sanction – This will be followed by the technical sanctioning and administrative sanctioning of the structures
Stage 4- Implementation- Upon this, the structures will thus be built. The time line for the soil and moisture conservation work will be the summer months i.e. April-May 2025. 

4.Innovative water-saving techniques, including mulching and micro-irrigation, are encouraged, alongside the cultivation of crops tailored to local environments, to ensure efficient water use.
Key stages of implementation-
Stage 1- Beneficiary identification- For promoting water-saving techniques, beneficiaries interested to adopt micro-irrigation will have to be identified and then making them understand the need and use of micro-irrigation will be the first step. 
Stage 2- Convergence with govt. schemes and community contribution for ownership- It will be seen if some farmers can be supported both from the project and with convergence from micro-irrigation schemes to subsidize the cost of buying drip and sprinklers. In this step, it will also be seen to set some community contribution to ensure ownership and accountability. 
Stage 3- Implementation- Further, support will be provided to source good quality micro-irrigation systems and to do demonstrations with drip and sprinklers along with practices like mulching to promote adoption of water-saving techniques in farming. 


5.It seeks to foster biodiversity by integrating native species and sustainable farming. Economically, the project aspires to enhance farmer incomes through crop diversification, cost-efficient practices, and added value to their produce.
Key stages of implementation-
Stage 1- Practicing NPM with farmers and plantation- By promoting the adoption of NPM, it will help restore soil health and soil microbial population and foster biodiversity. In addition to this, plantation of indigenous tree saplings will be done in the identified villages so that native species can be promoted. 
Stage 2- Procurement/ Aggregation of pesticide-free and safe produce- To help farmers have access to fair and remunerative prices, support will be given for aggregation to the farmers for transportation and labour costs to help with timely marketing of the pesticide free produce. 
Stage 3- Value addition of the aggregated produce- This aggregated produce will then be processed further to add value and sell to fetch better prices. 
Stage 4- Forward marketing through FPO- The value addition part and the market linkages will be done by the FPO we promote, named RRPPCL. 

6.This comprehensive strategy is designed to empower small and marginal farmers by reinforcing ecosystems to face climate adversities and elevate their economic standing.
Key stages of implementation-
Stage 1- Land use planning- To deal with climate adversities and elevate their income, land use planning is a strategy to be adopted where different fruit trees are given to plant in a said structure which will yield them an additional source of income throughout the year. 
Stage 2- Establishment of kitchen garden- Kitchen gardens or Nutri-gardens will be established with farmers to promote nutritional sufficiency as well as serve as a source for surplus income. Kitchen gardens kits will be distributed in all crop seasons keeping in mind the seasonality of vegetables starting this rabi season i.e. November-December. 
Stage 3- Crop diversification- Crop diversification is the focal point to mitigate the adversities of the climate change and increase the income of the farmers. This will be a focus in every crop season in the upcoming 2 years. 

Note: Community mobilization, Regular capacity building of the farmers and community members  is a common step which will be practiced to ensure proper implementation of the project throughout the project period. Other than that, liaisoning and convergence with various government departments and schemes will also be a common step in all activities to be undertaken under the project, as and when required.",approved,

In this stage, Plant With Purpose Burundi staff identify tree nursery sites and work with communities to prepare them. Through training via our Seeds of Change curriculum, Plant With Purpose Burundi staff prepare community members to construct shadehouses, purchase and/or collect seeds, establish seedbeds, fill biodegradable soil bags, and either directly sow or transplant seedlings into these bags. Grafting of fruit seedlings happens during this stage, as well as ongoing maintenance activities such as watering, maintaining the nurseries and shade houses, and guarding the seedlings with 24-hour security from community “forest guards.” 

2.  Tree planting campaign: October 2024 - March 30, 2025

Stage two involves identifying tree planting sites and mobilizing community members to plant the seedlings. This additionally involves preparing the planting sites through digging holes, transporting seedlings from nurseries, and planting the trees on these sites (on communal lands or in private farms owned by individual partnering farmers).

3.  Tree protection & Monitoring for AFR100: April 1, 2025 - August 15, 2029

promoting natural regeneration of native flora, including grasses, shrubs, and trees by planting 1,00,000 saplings. The selected land will be surveyed for biodiversity. This will be the initial survey for the before elements to be recorded. This will be carried out by first week of August 2024. Flora and fauna will be recorded before the land is prepared for restoration. Later, lantana eradication work will take place, depending on the amount of rainfall we get. There after the sites will be prepared for fencing, pit for poles will be dug. By April to May 2025, pits will be dug for planting saplings. In June 2025, saplings will be obtained, and the plantation process will begin. De-weeding and lantana eradication work will continue every year till the end of the project period. Saplings will be watered in the dry months after monsoon, depending on the moisture level in the soil. Watering of saplings will take place mostly by the end of November 2025 as and when needed. Bio fertilizer will be used in the saplings during the plantation period in June 2025 and during de-weeding in October 2025. 

2nd Intervention Pond rejuvenation: We will be revitalizing 10 natural ponds to foster enduring environmental advantages for local communities and wildlife. This activity will be initiated in April 2025. Ipomoea carnea will be eradicated from the identified village ponds manually. Once the plant is eradicated, it will be kept upside down in a dry area near the site. This will allow the plant to dry up and later can be used by the nearby villagers in the form of fuel wood.

3rd Intervention Micro-plan: Crafting comprehensive micro-plans for 11 villages in the buffer area, promoting 
sustainable development and fostering harmony between humans and wildlife. This activity will initiate from September 2024 and will end by October 2025. We will be making the micro-plan for 11 villages. This will include water source for agricultural land, what kind of NTFP activities take place, etc.

4th Intervention Establishing Self Help Groups: This activity will begin from July 2024. We will arrange a meeting with the villagers in presence of government officials to introduce our objectives and goals of the project. The villagers will be selected for the lantana uprooting work, fencing work & some will be appointed as caretakers for the restoration area. This will create employment opportunity.
We will also create a green nursery for preparing saplings. The saplings created will be utilized in the plantation site. The money will be given to the SHG which will create income for the selected people. The saplings created will be from locally found seeds like Arjuna (Terminalia arjuna), Saja (Terminalia elliptica), Sal (Shorea robusta), Bamboo grass (Bambusa vulgaris) to name a few. The sapling preparation will start from August 2024.

5th Intervention Sensitization: This activity will start from August 2024 and will greatly contribute to community participation and sustainability.

6th Intervention Biodiversity survey: Systematic recording of biodiversity within rehabilitated territories and tracking ecological transformations over time. We will be doing an initial survey before the lantana is removed and one after the lantana is removed. Later, Seasonal data will be collected for all three seasons i.e. monsoon, winter & summer. These surveys will be carried out every year so that we can get a proper data for comparison. This would help in recording the before and after intervention changes.",approved,

Distribution and Planting of Mango Seedlings (1st October-31st November May 2024):
Distributing mango seedlings on credit aids farmers without immediate payment burdens, fostering participation and oversight by service providers. Implementing a check-off system deducts seedling costs from harvest sales, ensuring project sustainability. Monitoring activities for 20 months track seedling progress, manage challenges, and optimize project success from planting to maturity.

Follow-up Activities and Monitoring
Regular Monitoring Field Visits (December 2024)
Regular field visits assess mango tree survival rates, taking of geospatial data, noting factors like pests, diseases, and care quality. Data collected aids in calculating overall survival and identifying areas for improvement. The team will evaluate irrigation, soil health, and farmer practices, intervening with pest control, irrigation adjustments, or training as needed.

Phase 3: Long-term Monitoring and Reporting
Project Progress Reporting and Field Visits (5th Jan 2025)
Follow-up reporting on project progress, tree restoration, hectares, and job creation. Conduct monitoring and verification field visits with partners for continued support and evaluation.
This comprehensive plan ensures effective implementation, continuous monitoring, and transparent reporting throughout the mango seedling distribution and planting project, promoting sustainable practices and community engagement over the project duration.

Field Visits (Feb 2025 - Mar 2025)
Continue with regular visits to mango seedling sites to assess their health and growth in natural rainfall conditions.
Data Collection: Gather data on seedling health metrics such as growth rates, leaf condition, pest infestations, and soil moisture levels influenced by natural rainfall patterns.

Data Analysis and Planning (Apr 2025 - Jun 2025):
Data Analysis: Analyze the collected data to determine seedling survival rates and identify early challenges or trends affected by natural rainfall dynamics.
Identification of Challenges: Identify specific issues such as water stress during dry periods, soil erosion risks, pest outbreaks following heavy rains, or nutrient leaching due to rainfall intensity.
Planning Interventions: Develop a detailed plan for ongoing monitoring activities, corrective interventions based on natural weather patterns, and any necessary training programs for farmers or caretakers regarding natural rainfall management.

Implementation of Interventions (Jul 2025 - Dec 2025):
Make necessary adjustments in care practices based on natural rainfall patterns, optimizing watering schedules during dry spells and adjusting nutrient applications accordingly.
Training Programs: Conduct training sessions emphasizing natural rainfall management, soil conservation practices, and resilient crop care techniques suited to local weather variations.

During stage one, Plant With Purpose DRC staff work with local leaders and communities to identify the community areas to be restored and provide tree planting training to Purpose Groups via our Seeds of Change curriculum. This involves meetings to determine where public and private tree nurseries will be established within the project areas. Before implementing the program, all parties need to agree on community planting site location, tree-monitoring methodology, and on adherence to a community forestry code. Plant With Purpose DRC then works on capacity building in communities within the project area. Local staff meet with community members and ensure the availability of resources and materials. They collect GPS data for a sample of the sites where tree nurseries will be established, when needed. Seeds of Change training is made available to communities through Purpose Group participation and Plant With Purpose DRC staff work within the partnering communities to establish the tree nurseries and prepare planting sites. Monitoring of seedling growth continues throughout this stage.

Stage 2 TREE PLANTING CAMPAIGN: July 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024

Once the seedlings are ready for planting, Plant With Purpose DRC organizes a tree planting campaign within communities and invites local leaders. Through Purpose Groups, Plant With Purpose DRC staff educate partnering farmers about planting and protecting the produced seedlings once planted on public or private land (the majority of seedlings will be planted in private agroforestry lots). Environmental technicians on staff provide further training and technical assistance. We then launch tree planting activities and mobilize farmers to plant trees.

Stage 3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION: December 31, 2024 to Approximately August 15, 2029

This stage involves Plant With Purpose DRC staff working with the farmers to monitor and evaluate the planted trees by identifying the growth rate of the trees, the current threats to the trees, keeping track of where the trees are planted (public vs. private land), and seeking solutions to any challenges and threats to the trees in the planting areas. Our monitoring process is continuous until the area is graduated, usually after 6-10 years, and our TerraFund for AFR100 reports are scheduled until August 15, 2029.",approved,

This plan will clearly outline the planting seasonality which is mostly dependent on the rainy season. The specific months for planting are December, April and October. This will therefore be staggered across the two and half years where planting will be taking place. The plan will also clearly outline the roles of each partner.
Implementation will thus start with capacity building on tree nursery establishment and Gender integration in tree growing projects. The existing tree nursery is expanding to accommodate the increase in numbers of the trees.
Project review meetings will be done after every six months where the challenges and opportunities will be identified and acted upon. Day to day monitoring of the project will be done by the community field-based officer and the community representatives.
Spot weeding in the forest will be done twice per year in the forest and in schools. The area is warm and thus trees take a short time to mature and within 3 years those planted within the forest or protected areas would be big and will not require more spot
weeding.
The program has taken capacity building as a key factor for maintenance and up scaling of the program.

Stage 1: Preparation and Germination of Seeds and Identification of Planting Sites -- This step will take place from January-March of 2024 and 2025 as our hired seedling nursery managers, overseen by Kula Agronomists, will germinate the seeds for coffee trees. Additionally, Kula's Nyamasheke Farm Trainer as well as Kula Operations Director will work with the local government in Nyamasheke to identify sites for planting additional trees. 

Stage 2: Preparation of Seedling Nurseries -- Because Kula has already constructed the seedling nursery in Nyamasheke, this stage will be focused on preparing the nursery bed, making any necessary changes, updates, and expansions to the nursery structure, acquiring quality agroforestry seedlings and transferring the germinated coffee seedlings to the nursery beds. This Stage will be implemented between March-July in 2024 and 2025.

Stage 3: Cultivation of Seedlings -- This stage will encompass the majority of both years from March-October of 2024 and 2025 as seedling nursery managers and Kula Agronomists provide the proper care and inputs needed to grow healthy seedlings as well as hiring local community members to place each seedling in an individual plastic seedling bag.

Stage 4: Identify Additional Farmers and Provision of Training on Proper Planting - Because Kula extends farm support and seedling distribution beyond program participants, we work with the local government to identify additional farmers who are able to receive seedlings based on need and farm expansion capacity. Kula Agronomists then provide planting training and visit each farm in order to ensure proper planting preparation techniques (size of holes dug, distance between holes, etc.). Additionally, through this project, Kula is working with the Nyamasheke District to identify additional land alongside Lake Kivu to plant the remaining indigenous trees in order to further work against land degradation, increase carbon sequestration and reduce the likelihood of erosion for local community members. During this stage, Kula staff, alongside hired community members, will be working to properly prepare these sites for planting. This stage will take place in October 2024 and 2025.

Stage 5: Seedling Distribution and Planting - Due to the rainy seasons in Rwanda, November-December is regarded as planting season. Depending on the amount of rain that is received, planting can take place anytime in November to December and has even extended into January in some recent years. Seedlings are distributed to all Fellows and community members who then plant them in their own individual smallholder farms. Additionally, local community members will also be hired to plant the additional trees in the sites designated by the local government. This will take place between November-December 2024 and 2025.  

Stage 6: Monitoring and Evaluation - Based on the co-designed monitoring plan developed with Terrafund, Kula will implement the agreed upon monitoring and reporting process as well as continue our proprietary Impact Measurement system for the program overall. This stage will take place from 2024-2030.

Throughout each stage listed, Kula will be simultaneously conducting the Kula Fellowship Program, providing monthly agronomy training alongside various farm inputs, business training and investment, and personal development services including mentorship.",approved,

Community Mobilization and Planning (Year 1): During the first year, the project will focus on community mobilization efforts, conducting meetings, and consultations with local communities. The objective is to raise awareness about the project, gain community support, and establish partnerships with relevant stakeholders. Detailed restoration plans will be developed based on community input and the specific needs and characteristics of the project area. Tree planting activities will also commence in year one, emphasizing the importance of early restoration actions. 2. Site Preparation and Tree Nursery Establishment (Year 1-2): From the first to second year, site preparation activities will take place, including land clearing, soil preparation, and the establishment of tree nurseries. Local community members, including women and youth, will be involved in these activities, providing employment opportunities. The nurseries will serve as a source of seedlings for tree planting in subsequent years. 3. Tree planting and Agroforestry Implementation (Years 1- 2): Years 1 to 2 will focus on the actual tree planting and agroforestry implementation. Tree planting activities will be carried out in cocoa farms and other suitable areas identified through community consultations. Agroforestry systems will be established, combining cocoa cultivation with shade trees and other complementary crops. This approach will enhance biodiversity, improve soil health, provide additional income streams, and promote sustainable land management practices. 4. Maintenance and Monitoring (Years 1-6): Throughout the project, regular maintenance activities will be conducted to ensure the survival and growth of the planted trees. This includes weeding, pruning, and pest control measures. Monitoring and evaluation efforts will assess the progress and impact of the project, tracking parameters such as tree survival rates, biodiversity enhancement, and the socio-economic benefits to local communities. This information will guide adaptive management decisions and ensure the project's effectiveness. 5. Capacity Building and Training (Years 1-6): Capacity building and training programs will be an ongoing component of the project. Training sessions will be conducted for community members, focusing on sustainable land management practices, agroforestry techniques, entrepreneurship skills, and value-addition opportunities. Women and youth will be specifically targeted, empowering them to actively participate in and benefit from the restoration efforts. 6. Project Evaluation and Knowledge Sharing (Year 6): In the final year of the project, a comprehensive evaluation will be conducted to assess the overall outcomes and impact of the project. Lessons learned, best practices, and success stories will be documented and shared with relevant stakeholders, including local communities, government agencies, and other restoration practitioners. This knowledge sharing will contribute to the broader understanding of community-led restoration approaches and help guide future restoration efforts.",approved,

•	Baseline Survey and Identification of restoration area.
•	Formation of village level organization and identification of village level volunteer.
•	Capacity building of village level institution, volunteers and communities about the implementation of the project activities
•	Handholding support to communities for implementation of the particular project activities. 
•	Networking with government department.
•	Follow up and monitoring. 

Activity wise implementation stages 
Restoration: - will significantly enhance biodiversity by introducing a diverse array of trees, medicinal plants, and traditional crops, cultivating a rich ecosystem, and promoting local plant varieties. This initiative is expected to strengthen socioeconomic conditions by restoring land and fostering natural farming, thus reducing agricultural costs, increasing soil fertility, and curbing migration by boosting farm yields benefitting over 5,000 individuals. 

•	Baseline Survey and Identification of restoration area: Before implementing the activity we will conduct a baseline survey to find out who is the family with whom we want to do this activity, how much land does the family have, what crops do they grow, whether they have plantation in their fields or not, what kind of farming do they do chemical or organic, how much income they get from farming etc. We will collect all the information so that better planning can be done with the farmers.

•	Formation of village level organization and identification of village level volunteer: The role of village level institutions is more important for better implementation and continuity of the project. After conducting baseline survey and analyzing the problem, we will form village level institutions like SHG/VDC which will help us in better implementation of project activities at the ground level. Along with this, we will identify some volunteers at the village level who will help us in running the project activities smoothly at the village level.

•	Capacity building of village level institution, volunteers and communities: Capacity building is an important part of any program because no program can be successful without capacity building of the functionaries, village level institutions and the community. For example, after formation of any village level organization and identification of volunteers, we will build their capacity on different subjects to make them stronger so that they can reach the right information to the people of the community and make them aware.

•	Handholding support to communities: - After capacity building and training of community and village level institution MJVS team will provide handholding support to community for implementation of activity and taking the benefits of government’s schemes. MJVS has proper monitoring system and monitoring team which checks the success of the activities and gives suggestions.
•	Networking with government department: - Keeping in mind the objectives of the project, it is necessary to contact the Gram Panchayat and government departments so that the distance between the community and the government departments can be mitigate. For that we will organised village level and block level interface meetings between government department and community along with this we will also organised the District and state level consultation meeting with government department for better implementation of government schemes at grass root level.
•	Follow up and monitoring: Follow up and monitoring is a main part of any program because if we are doing any activities with community so their follow-up and proper monitoring is very important. Without follow up and monitoring any program or activities has been not sustained. MJVS has proper team for proper follow up and monitoring of any activities and program. MJVS will undertake follow-up and monitoring at both levels during the project and after the completion of the project.

Watershed development: - watershed infrastructures, such as ponds and dams, in collaboration with local authorities, will elevate water levels, facilitating year-round agriculture and improving community livelihoods. 

•	Formation of village level organization and identification of village level volunteer: The role of village level institutions is more important for better implementation and continuity of the project. After conducting baseline survey and analyzing the problem, we will form village level institutions like SHG/VDC which will help us in better implementation of project activities at the ground level. Along with this, we will identify some volunteers at the village level who will help us in running the project activities smoothly at the village level.

•	Prepare village development plan through the support of village level institution: For works related to soil and water conservation, we will prepare village development plans (micro plans) at the village level with the help of village development committees and village panchayats.

•	Submit village development plan in Gramsabha for the approval through the support of village level institution: After the village development plan is prepared, we will present it to the Gram Sabha for approval with the help of village level institutions (SHGs and VDCs). After the approval of the village development plans, all works related to soil and water conservation will be done by the Gram Panchayat under MGNREGA schemes.

•	Follow up and monitoring during the implementation: After the approval of the village development plans, all works related to soil and water conservation will be done by the Gram Panchayat under MGNREGA schemes. But time to time its monitoring and follow up is more important of better implementation and quality improved. 

Cultivation of Fruit Trees: - The focus on planting predominantly fruit trees serve dual purposes of providing a steady source of income for families and acting as a financial safety net. Food security will see marked improvements through kitchen gardens and the cultivation of fruit trees and indigenous crops, ensuring a reliable source of nutrition for the community. Under this activity we will plant 11th types of fruit trees which are given below: Awla,Custard Apple, Neem, Drumstick, Jamun, Guav, Karanj, Harra, Baheda, Mahua and Arjun.

•	Site Preparation: This activity involves preparation of selected restoration sites for the project for plantation; work preparation at the site includes clearing vegetation, fencing, building infrastructure and preparing the land for planting.

•	Tree Nursery Management: Under this activity, we will establish a nursery at each of our four locations where nurseries of fruit plants will be prepared so that plants can be easily made available at a low cost. The work of setting up and managing the nursery will be done by Gram Vikas Samitis or SHGs, which will provide employment to the people of the group and plants will also be prepared at the local level.

•	Tree Planting: After the site preparation and nursery is ready, the next task is to plant the plants at the right place. For this, we will train our team about the things to keep in mind while planting such as how big the pit should be, what should be the distance between the plants and lines, which crops should be planted in intercropping and which should not, how to put supporters if the plants are big, etc.

•	Material Inputs: After planting the saplings, it includes providing organic fertilizers and organic pesticide from time to time, fencing for the protection of the plants and arranging irrigation resources etc.

•	Tree & Site Maintenance: This includes management, monitoring and follow up of plants.

Animal Husbandry: - the project's support for animal husbandry will yield higher milk production, contributing to both nutritional and economic welfare.

In the inception phase, together with LEAD Foundation we will start selecting villages and reaching out to village leaders. We will then select champion farmers from these villages, who will be trained at the start of the implementation phase, which starts in October 2022. We will organise Training of Trainers (ToT) sessions, during which our champion farmers receive elaborate training on our regreening techniques, leadership and administrative skills. Once these champions return to their villages and start training other farmers, the actual regreening begins. Gradually, more and more farmers will be activated and start bringing back trees on their farmland. Our rural marketing activities will then start as well, such as the movie roadshow and the SMS service. Champion farmers and program coordinators will play an important role in our monitoring approach in this phase. This phase will continue for three years, during which our champion farmers will receive two more follow-up training sessions. After the implementation phase, the sustainability phase will start in October 2025. Here, we gradually scale down our activities and will have a stronger focus on rural marketing and communication. The aim of the sustainability phase is to at least sustain the realised impact, while we keep promoting the regreening movement. Our champion farmers will play a smaller role and gradually become ambassadors of regreening in their villages. This phase will take another 17 years, which will bring the total program during to 20 years and is proposed to end in October 2042. With this approach, we aim to embed the regreening movement into the communities. For more background about our interventions: https://vimeo.com/325842883",approved,existing_expansion

Provide any necessary explanations for the project activity timelines included as part of your project budget. 

The project is proposed to start in first quarter 2022 with the mobilization/engagement of communities, including awareness on the project. This will be followed by working with the communities to set up structures that will be directly involved in the project implementation and setting up farmers field schools. The project team will work with the communities to delineate and select the specific sites identified within the landscape for the agroforestry scheme and commence field preparation. Within the same period, the project will gather cocoa and coconut seedlings for the first cycle of the project as well as collect seeds to be put on nursery for the forest tree. The planting of food crops (cassava and vegetables) and temporary shade trees (plantain and banana) will start in March to ensure that they are well established prior to transplanting of the cocoa seedlings in June. By October of 2022, the project will begin to set up large-scale nurseries that will form the core of the cocoa/coconut agroforestry scheme for the rest of the project with resumption of the planting season in June of 2023. By 2024, the project expects to have completed the planting of targeted number of trees. Tree maintenances start as of the first year of planting in 2022. The project team will work with the communities to maintain the trees during the first 3 years. Within this period the communities will be trained to take on responsibility for the management of the program including maintenance of the trees (shade/weeding, pruning pest management, organic fertilizer use etc). The project is expected to begin to see concrete results from the tree planting within the 3-5 years. Most of the maintenance efforts will focus on the cocoa and coconut with limited maintenance of the native trees required after this time.",approved,new_project

The key stages of the proposed project will be : 

1) Preliminary Phase :
 
a) Hiring of Project Team members :
        Here, all the effort will be to identify and recruit the competent staff for the project as per the need and 
        requirement of the programme.  

b) Engagement with stakeholders like Panchayat, existing peoples institutions and line departments. 
    
c) Orientation of the Project Team members :
          Once the project team is identified and recruited, the team will be provided orientation about the overall 
          programme objective, component and intervention for smooth implementation of the programme.

 d) Identification of Project Beneficiaries (Women Farmer) and Project Sites :
         In this phase, the identification and selection of the women farmer will be done based on our selection criteria.  At the same time, the project sites 
         will also be identified in consultation with the village PRI members, VDC members etc. where the activities will be initiated.       
    
2)  Project Implementation Phase :
    This will include, the actual implementation of all the project major components like Tree Plantation, Water Resource Development, Soil and Moisture 
    Conservation work, Sustainable Agriculture Practices, Material inputs and Community Mobilising, Organising and Strengthening, including their 
     institutions.
     
3)  Project Maintenance Phase : 
     This phase of the project will enable project PRI members and Women Farmers of the project to manage and 
     maintain the intervention completed during the project period. The required training and capacity building will be 
     provided to the Women Farmers.  Appropriate linkages with government departments, agriculture universities and other related stakeholders will be 
      done so that these initiatives remain sustained beyond project period with suitable partnership between community and these stakeholders. 

4)  Project Process Documentation and Reporting : 
     This phase will include the identification of the best practices, documentation and dissemination of good case study 
     to the supporting agency for the entire project cycle, i.e from Project Planning to Maintenance phase. Here, we will also prepare and submit the 
      Quarterly, Half Yearly and Annual Report to the supporting agency in the prescribed format. Process Documentation is very key for not only getting to 
      know what is going on in the programme but also to derive lessons, take corrective actions, identify success stories and wider dissemination. 

5) Project Monitoring and Review Phase :
     This will be the second last phase of the project where the monitoring and review by the supporting agency or third 
     party can come to visit the project and interact with the project women farmer beneficiaries and project sites and other stakeholders such as 
     Government and PRI functionaries.

6)  Project Evaluation Phase :
      Cohesion Foundation Trust, is a grassroot organisation and welcome the evaluation of their programme by third party appointed by the supporting 
       agency to review the project being implemented and as part of the compliance.

The intended outcomes of the intervention in Sidhi District encompass environmental, social, and economic dimensions, with engaging the primary producers and NTFPs (Non-Timber Forest Products) gathers in value chain and market system to undertake market orientated production and supply of tree- based produces. The expected outcomes and impacts expected over a defined timeline:
•	Environmental: By the end of the project timeline, greater realization of economic and ecological value of important tree species and thereby progress is anticipated in landscape restoration with enhanced biodiversity and improved ecological resilience to climate change impacts. This will be achieved through capacity building of the community on Tree Management Practices, Good Environment Practices, and Sustainable Harvesting Practices.

•	Social: Communities are expected to experience improved livelihoods with positive impact on almost 3000 beneficiaries, creation of 50 jobs, increased income opportunities from sustainable forest-based enterprises. Additionally, social inclusion is aimed for, particularly among marginalized groups, fostering community cohesion and empowerment. The community will be collectivized through 
•	Economic: Over the project duration, there should be visible economic benefits, including higher incomes for farmers and NTFPs gatherers engaged in tree-based value chains, improved market access, and the establishment of sustainable business models. This economic growth is intended to be inclusive, benefiting women and tribal communities.

The following key activities will be undertaken under the aforementioned ESE framework:

1.	Inception Meeting to finalize the Program Design and Action Planning (July/August 2024): ILRT to organize an Inception Meeting, bringing together the HBF and ILRT teams. The meeting will help to bring better understanding about the overall project design and validations of the target set along with discussion of broad approaches, strategies, activities and results.

2.	Stakeholder Consultation at Sidhi for partnerships building with Government and Non-government departments at Sidhi (August/September 2024): The stakeholder consultations will be organized at district level to build a better understanding of the project, its various components and also building partnerships with multiple stakeholders including NABARD, Forest Department, Horticulture Department, SRLMs, KVK, MSME RGMWM and others. This collaborative approach aims to ensure a smoother implementation of the project.

3.	Selection of Geographies, Villages and Target communities around Key Value Chains (July/August 2024): This activity will be done in July/August, 2024, in the designated Majhauli, Sidhi, and Rampur Naikin blocks. The focus will be on identifying villages wherein the Mahua, Jackfruits and Bamboo are already being produced by the farmers as well as there is further potential for plantation of these tree species. This selection process involves a comprehensive assessment of ecological conditions encompassing topography, existing vegetation, current condition of the targeted trees and understanding the impact of climate change on growth patterns and ecological degradation. Integral to this assessment is the active involvement and engagement of local communities within selected villages, their long-term commitment to sustainability and species restoration. Leveraging Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in visualizing ecological parameters, enabling the analysis of spatial data to identify villages conducive to smooth monitoring and evaluation.

4.	Baseline Analysis and Setting Key Performance Parameters (August 2024) This activity will be done in the second quarter, (August 2024), this study will be conducted to comprehensively analyze and grasp the current conditions, challenges, and opportunities within the targeted land areas. This comprehensive assessment will encompass various dimensions, including the identification of the socio-economic condition of the targeted households, livelihood dependency of the households on Jackfruit, Bamboo and Mahua trees, as well as a thorough assessment of potential risks and opportunities associated with the restoration efforts. This baseline study would be used to analyze the impact of this project on the targeted households after the intervention.

5.	Community Mobilization and Organizations (PGs) (Quarter- 1 and Quarter-2 2024): As planned in the project, the community will be collectivized into producer groups so that activities can be undertaken as group activities and meetings, trainings and intervention can be well organized. Thirty contiguous villages will be undertaken where communities are already engaged in Mahua, Jackfruit and bamboo cultivation or collection. 

6.	Capacity Building of Producer Groups (Quarter 2 2024): The community in 30 villages will be collectivized into about 150 Producer Groups. These groups will be farmers with access to either Mahua or Jackfruit or Bamboo or any of the combination. The groups would be trained in governance, record keeping, and saving similar to self-help groups. This group would be basic pillars of the project. ILRT will prepare specific modules in Hindi for training of these groups. The groups may be newly formed or adopted or revived from any existing self-help group in the village.  

7.	Capacity Building for Farmers on Sustainable harvesting and conservation and management practices (Quarter- 3 and Quarter-4 2024/2025 and during fruiting season): The Producer Groups or selected farmers from the group would be provided with training on sustainable harvesting practices, tree management practices for better management and conservation of the trees. ILRT's primary focus lies in capacitating farmers comprehensively, from tree conservation to marketing, and sales of value-added products derived from Mahua, Jackfruit, and Bamboo. The capacity-building programs entail diverse training modules concentrating on planting methodologies, conservation techniques, and agroforestry practices. ILRT is dedicated to educating farmers about the multifaceted economic, environmental, and social benefits derived from conserving and cultivating these three species.

8.	Value Chain Analysis (Quarter - 4 2025 and during fruiting season):  ILRT will conduct a short value chain mapping exercise to map key value chain players (traders, processors, institutions, service providers) to gauge the potential and challenge and also plan point of interventions in value chain development. The community, through Producer Groups, will be trained on the concept of Value Chain and Market System development and specific training will be provided on various dimensions of value chain interventions. 

9.	Value chain Intervention including promoting processing unit (Quarter – 4 2025 and during fruiting season): In relation to Mahua and Jackfruit,  market connect with traders outside Sidhi, value addition interventions including – primary processing of cleaning, and grading would be promoted. Promotion of processing of Mahua and Jackfruit into value-added/baked products will be promoted through establishment of processing unit at cluster level. Similar, opportunity for Bamboo trade, processing and value-addition would be explored and necessary training will be provided to selected producer groups.

10.	Capacity Building for Farmers on Value chain (Quarter - 4 2025 and during flowering/fruiting season): In relation to Mahua and Jackfruit for planned value addition interventions, the producer groups will be provided necessary	trainings with the help of experts and also exposure visit of few selected producer group or farmers would be conducted for their capacity building. 

11.	Documentation of Case stories and Human-Interest Stories: In addition to training, community engagement initiatives to facilitate networking opportunities, the exchange of success stories, experiences, and challenges, would be documented for knowledge sharing and dissmimenation.

12.	Access Finance and Financial Linkages (Quarter - 4 2025 and during Value chain intervention stage) – Access to finance for rural initiatives will be facilitated through partnerships with the State Rural Livelihood Mission, Corporate Social Responsibility, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), and others. These collaborative efforts aim to provide essential financial support, resources, and expertise to the targeted households. 

13.	Convergence with Government and other partners (All quarters): ILRT would work to explore opportunities for the communities for plantation, processing or others in relation to value chain promotion of Mahua, Jackfruits, Bamboo or other through Government program, scheme or other opportunities.

14.	Market Planning (during value chain intervention and thereafter)– ILRT aims to strategically position and distinguish its value-added Mahua, Jackfruit, and Bamboo products by concentrating on crafting unique selling propositions (USPs) and defining their value propositions. ILRT would start with trade linkage and market connect for better price for NTFP commodity and then apprach for primary processing with technological interventions.

15.	Monitoring and Evaluation (All Quarters) - ILRT would monitor and evaluate every quarter. For implementing value-added products derived from Jackfruit, Mahua, and Bamboo across the entire production process, from pre-production to post-production stages.

ILRT intend to offer these products across diverse market channels, extending their reach from local markets to the broader Madhya Pradesh (MP) market. This strategic approach seeks to showcase the distinctive benefits and qualities of their products, catering to various market segments while leveraging multiple distribution channels for widespread accessibility and appeal. 4Ps Product, Price, Place, Promotion.
The interventions for Quarter 5 and onwards will be incontinuance with previous year and more focussed on market linkage, micro-enterprise promtion, value addition and vale chain development.",approved,

Preparation: January-February 2024. Eden will work with Ol-pusimoru Forest Block's Community Forest Association to determine the 70 ha area within Eden's adopted Ol Mariko restoration site. 

Seed collection and nursery production: October 2023-December 2024. Eden accepts seed on a rolling basis according to our planting goals. Seed is sourced locally from a variety of mother trees, and is purchased from community members by weight, based on established rates. It should be noted that in order to prepare for the March 2024 planting season, seedling production must begin in the nursery in October 2023.

Baseline monitoring: February - March 2024, August-October 2024, January-March 2025, August-October 2025. In advance of each planting season, Eden conducts baseline monitoring activities to support its monitoring and evaluation goals.

Site preparation: March -April 2024 and October - November 2024. Eden's restoration teams prepare planting sites by pitting holes in advance of planting, as well as preparing naturally available bamboo for fencing sections of planted areas where needed.

Planting: During Kenya's rainy seasons which occur March-May and October-December. Over the 1 year planting period, there are 2 planting seasons. Due to uncertainty with rainfall patterns, this gives the organization ample time to accommodate unexpected weather over the planting period to achieve the full planting target.

Fire management trainings and watchtower installation: 2024-2025, dates not yet determined. 

Internal progress review: January 2025. Eden will review planting progress and ensure that operations are on track to hit the goals of the project. Additionally, the internal progress review allows the team to bring forward any challenges that may have arisen in the first year in order to ensure they are adequately addressed.

In this phase of the project, we will carry out the launch of the project, stakeholders’ workshop where we will discuss the project objects, proposed milestone and work plan, this will be done in a participatory manner together with the communities and local stakeholders. This is also the period when Participatory land use planning will be done. Tree nursery establishment and expansion will be initiated the same period and will continue to the end of the year.
In March 2024, major preparation will be done by identifying tree seedlings that will be ready for planting, farmers that will be ready for planting, the site preparation will be done the same time. 
Tree planting – April/ June 2024 is the long rain season in this region thus in April  and June 2024 tree planting will be done, the number of trees planted will be based on availability of ready seedlings , availability of rains and the farmers that will be ready. We aim to plant at least 50,000 trees during this period.
In October/November 2024, this is also a rainy season in this region, though not much rain. Planting will be continued and the number of trees to be planted will be based on the availability of seedlings, readiness of the farmers and availability of rainfall. We will do a thorough evaluation in this period to establish the survival rate per farmer and support in replacement to ensure that the tree survival is at least 70%.
Maintenance and monitoring will be done continuously, the project will engage extension officers and lead farmers who will carry out day to day monitoring and training support.
Every 6 months from January 2024, we will carry out project evaluation to document trees planted, survival rates, number of the community member trained, livelihoods initiatives started by the communities as a result of the project and number of jobs created by the project. An assessment of the number of trees planted by end of the year will be done in December 2024 and planning for 2025 will also be done.

Appointment of staff	- Jun-Jul 2024	- Staff will be appointed for the project. Some of the staff will be from our existing team.
Capacity building of staff	- Jun - Dec 2024 - Capacity building programmes will be organised for the project team members on issues such as soil & water conservation measures, local biodiversity, participatory research methodologies, seed collection & storage, nursery raising, tree plantation, live fencing, production and use of organic manures/ bio-pesticides, maintenance of plantation, low-cost irrigation methods, etc.
Community mobilisation - Jun - Sep 2024  - We have been involved in community mobilisation work in this area for a long time on issues such as land and forest rights along with land and forest-based livelihoods of local tribal communities (Thakur, Mahadeo Koli and Katkari) for more than 20 years. As a matter of fact, tribal people have been able to gain possession and collective occupation rights over all the proposed restoration sites (Dalli lands) as part of our work on forest land rights.
Community participation - Regular and on-going - Active participation of the community will be a crucial aspect of the tree plantation programme. Efforts will be made to closely involve members of local tribal communities in various aspects related to site preparation, land surveys, choice of species, digging of pits, seed collection, raising saplings, planting, maintenance, protection, monitoring of the plantations, etc. Community members will be a key stakeholder in the efforts to undertake restoration of degraded Dalli lands.
Site preparation	- Jun 2024 onwards - Work will be initiated on surveys of the Dalli plots, marking of boundaries, clearing of the site, digging of shallow trenches around the sites for planting of a thorny fence followed by a live fence, laying down of baselines and grid lines, etc.
Preparation of organic manures - Jun 2024 onwards - Compost Pits will be dug on different parts of the Dalli plot and organic manures such as compost, Farm Yard Manure, vermicompost, Jeevamrut, etc. will be prepared on the restoration site and used as manure for the plants.
Seed collection - Jun 2024 onwards - A phenology calendar will be prepared to determine the flowering, fruiting and seed collection times of different plant species in the region. Seed collection zones will be marked based on availability of seeds of diverse species. Collection of seeds of different plants will be undertaken at different times of the year depending on availability. The collected seeds will be cleaned, dried, labelled and stored in cloth bags.
Nursery raising - Jun-Jul 2024 onwards - A couple of nurseries close to the restoration site will be contracted for raising saplings of different fruit trees, timber trees, uncultivated food plants, medicinal plants and NTFP species. Saplings of many of these species are generally not grown by nurseries in the region. Assigning the task of raising saplings to existing nurseries will be more cost effective than setting up our own nurseries. Seeds of diverse plant species collected from forest areas will be provided to the nurseries for raising saplings. Direct sowing of seeds will also be done for different plants, especially along the live fence and in rocky/ infertile areas of the restoration site.
Digging of pits - Jun-Jul 2024, Mar-May 2025 - Pits will be dug in the months of summer during 2024 and 2025. 
Thorny fence - Jun 2024 onwards - A dry thorny fence consisting mainly of Karvanda, Pirkut, etc. will be erected around the restoration site to protect saplings that will be planted in the month of June 2024.
Planting of live fence around the site - Jun-Jul 2024 and 2025 - Along with the dry fence, a live fence will be planted around the restoration site with thorny and bushy plant species suitable for growing as hedge plants. Seeds or cuttings of species such as Euphorbia trigona (Pirkut), Vitex negundo (Nirgudi), Carissa congesta (Karvanda), Flacourtia indica (Atrun), Adhatoda vasica (Adulsa), Citrus limon (Limbu), Lawsonia inermis (Mehendi), Acacia concinna (Shikekai), Asparagus racemosus (Shatavari), Jatropha curcas (Chandrajyot); etc. will be planted along the boundary of the land at the onset of monsoon to grow a live fence. The live fence will have multiple benefits. It will protect the plants growing on the land from grazing by livestock, prevent soil erosion, act as a windbreak and also resist forest fires to some extent. The 'live fence' plants have medicinal, food or cosmetic value and can be used for self-consumption or sold in the market.
Tree planting - Jun-Jul 2024 and 2025 - 4-5 month old saplings of some of the fast growing species will be planted in the monsoon season of 2024 while saplings of slow growing plants and plants whose seeds are available only after March-April will be maintained in the nurseries till May 2025. One to one & half year good quality saplings of diverse plant species will thus be available for planting only during the 2025 monsoon seasons. Grafts of fruit trees will be procured from the Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth at Dapoli, Ratnagiri District or the Fruit Research Station at Vengurla, Sindhudurg District during the 2024 and 2025 monsoon seasons. One year old saplings will not be available in the first year since the saplings grown in nursery during the 2024 monsoon season will be barely 3-4 months old. Planting small saplings will result in a very high mortality rate and will defeat the entire purpose of the restoration programme. In the case of fruit trees (like mango, jackfruit, guava, jamun and cashew) plants will also be grown through direct seeding or by planting seedlings followed by in situ grafting with suitable varieties on one year old plants on the restoration sites. This will result in saving of resources while ensuring better survival and growth of grafted plants. Saplings of Mes and Manya bamboos will be procured from local farmers and planted on the site during the 2024 and 2025 monsoon seasons. Seeds of different plant species collected from the forest will also be used for growing plants in rocky and infertile areas of the restoration site.
Arrangements for watering of plants - 2024 to 2025	- Underground water storage tanks and ferrocement tanks of upto 10,000 litres each will be built at various spots on the Dalli land to improve availability of water for watering of plants. The water tanks will be located at higher levels so that water can flow with gravity. A pump-set and pipeline will be used for lifting water from ponds located at lower levels.
Soil & Moisture Conservation - 2024 - 2025 - Soil & Moisture Conservation measures such as mulching and cover crops will be used extensively to conserve moisture.
Clearing fire breaks or fire lines - 2024 and 2025 - Fire lines or fire breaks will be cleared around the restoration sites during the months of November - December each year to prevent the spread of forest fires into the plantation area during the dry period. Once established, the green live fence will also protect the plants from forest fires to some extent.
Maintenance - 2024 and 2025 - Regular maintenance is the key to ensure good survival and growth of plants on the restoration sites. A calendar will be prepared for carrying out regular maintenance activities such as watering, weeding, turning & loosening of soil, mulching, pruning, and manuring of the plants. Efforts will be made to explore use of low-cost drip irrigation system for watering plants. Organic mulch consisting of wood chips, leaves, twigs or grass will be used around the plants instead of plastic mulch. In the case of pest/ disease attacks, bio-pesticides will be prepared and used to protect the plants. Similarly, organic manures such as compost, Farm Yard Manure, vermicompost, Jeevamrut, etc. will be prepared on the restoration sites and used as manure for the plants.
Monitoring - Jun 2024 onwards - Regular monitoring of the plantation will provide inputs for proper maintenance and protection of the plants growing at the restoration sites. Aspects such as height of plants; health of plants; mortality of saplings; symptoms of pest/ disease attacks; presence of rodents; compaction of soil around the plants; absence of organic mulch; lack of moisture in the soil; functioning of the watering system; effectiveness of the live fence and fire line; protection systems; etc. will be closely monitored periodically to identify any problems or issues pertaining to the plantation. Proper monitoring formats will be prepared with advice and training from experts and a dedicated monitoring team will be given the responsibility to regularly monitor the plantations.",approved,

It will start with a field visit to the project sites in February 2024 by ILEG and key strategic partners including the County Government, Kenya Forest Research Institute, and Kenya Wildlife Conservancy Association. The visit will mainly survey the project sites and acquaint community volunteers and groups to work with, and confirm suitable tree species and numbers required. A project inception will be conducted in March 2024 to introduce project to wider community and stakeholders.

In the months of  March, April and May 2024 establishment of tree nursery will be rolled out based on the identified required tree species. This will be repeated in the months of July, August and September in readiness for October to December planting season. The same schedule will be repeated in 2025.  Basic tree growing training will be conducted for the identified community groups and farmer groups in April 2024.

Site preparation (site clearing, digging holes etc.) will be conducted in the month of October/December  and March/May 2025 . Tree planting will be carried out during the long rains (March/April/May) and the short rains (October/November/December) in 2024, 2025.

Our restoration implementation activities are determined and designed through series of education, town hall meetings, focus group discussion and baseline study involving the local people and the traditional authorities. The local people must agree to stop uncontrolled fire, agree to help plant and manage the trees, and agree to share the revenue. The traditional authorities, the custodians of the land must agree to allocate land for planting. Both activities are developed by the local people so that a fair and transparent system set up to share the revenue. Our implementation stages involve community mobilization, registration of the local people, training and recruitment of seasonal and part-time workers from the local community for nursery construction and management. We contract local famers to engage in seed collection. This is followed by site selection, demarcation and preparation. We engage the local people to manually prepare the planting sites. We supported with cutlasses, axes, hoes, protecting gears, transportation, food and water. After land preparation, we conduct pegging and planting of seedlings. We generally use 3m X 3m planting spacing. After planting, we conduct tree survival assessment. During this stage, we replace all the dead trees. Fires and competing weeds are major threats to planted trees. We maintain the planted trees by managing weeds and fires and occasional grazing. We manage weeds by supporting local people to manually clear their planting sites twice in a year. We recruit, train and contract local people to form community fire management advisory group. This group control, prevent, monitor and suppress fire activities during the dry season when wildfires are very active. We established fire-belts along the plantation boundary. We become part of the community and make our presence well established through project implementation. Our field officers live in the communities and provide day-to-day management and monitoring of implementation activities. The project monitoring team routinely conduct field monitoring once every month. Every six month, the project manager engages with the field officers to discuss the monitoring report and provide solutions to any implementation challenges",approved,

ones for replanting in the subsequent rainy season. In the first and 2

and years, the farmers will be

trained on tree management practices and monitoring.

The tree will reach maturity at different times. The trees planted in forest and riparian areas are
indigenous and take many years to mature and will not be harvested. The trees planted on farms
will be both indigenous and exotic. The exotic will be harvested from 5 to 10 years.
The maintenance will take in the 2nd and 3rd years. KENVO will monitor the maintenance over
time. However, maintenance activities for planted trees will continue up to when the trees
mature up to 20th Year.

Lastly, KENVO and the community will patrol and monitor the forests to flush out illegal
activities on a quarterly basis from 2022 to 2024. We will make use of technology - mobile apps

The organization collaborates with local communities to build climate resilience and establish long-term food-security through water conservation and the planting of indigenous, drought-resistant, food-bearing trees. Sadhana Forest Kenya grows tree saplings that we distribute to local people—free of charge—and then plant together with them around their homes. Ultimately the trees will provide a food source for the families. Concurrently, we carry out water conservation work and train individuals in basic water conservation and reforestation techniques. In this way we are providing thousands of malnourished families with long-term plant-based food security, while at the same time protecting them from the devastating effects of drought, desertification, and climate change. Our approach is community-centered, long-term oriented, and aimed at capacity building. We empower local communities through collaborative aid. The aim is to support rural people in becoming more resilient and independent in the face of increasing climatic and economic challenges.",approved,existing_expansion

This stage will involve the following activities:
1. Hiring project team. ARDE has a standardized hiring process that will be used to find a competent team that will help the project achieve its goals. Recruitment of the project team will be conducted as soon as the funding is approved. 
2.	Meetings with key stakeholders for the project launch.
3.	Development of a monitoring framework, getting the inputs of all stakeholders including the farmer's representatives.
4.	The baseline situation analysis will be part of this stages 

Stage 2: Community mobilization (Feb - May 2024)
This stage will involve all activities related to community engagement and capacity building of farmers 
1.	Introduction meetings and confirmation of needs at the community level.
2.	Training of farmers about  sustainable agricultural and land management (SALM), with an emphasis on agroforestry practices (agroforestry products and services, agroforestry farm plan, nursery development, and trees management practices and other SALM practices)
First, consultative meetings with local authorities at district, sector, cell, and village levels will be held. We will meet village leaders, executives of sectors, and district officers (e.g., land managers, environmental officers, etc.) to inform them about the project, how it will be implemented, and the benefits (medium and long-term) that will accrue from the project. Based on our past experience, the meetings with local authorities provide a solid foundation for project implementation and help in community mobilization. The meetings will also help us to confirm the needs, including specific locations affected by degradation such as gullies.
Then, we will convene community meetings with the communities in respective sectors, where the project team members will provide detailed information about the project, including its goals and outcomes, benefits that will, as well as the role of community participation in achieving the project goals. The overall aim of these meetings will be to raise awareness and sensitize farmers about the benefits of adopting agroforestry practices on their farms. 
After awareness-raising meetings, we will form groups of farmers and establish the groups to put in place group leaders who will help to organize the groups. The groups will get agroforestry-related training, the project will train the groups on other aspects to increase their entrepreneurship and business skills, which will further empower the groups and help them improve their livelihoods even after the project ends. 
The meetings will also provide an opportunity to brief the community about the project implementation plan, how the community members will be involved, and the benefits (both direct and indirect) of their involvement. Suggestions and remarks from meetings will be considered during the project implementation. 

Stage 3: Nursery establishment and seedbed preparation (Feb 2024 – Dec  2025 )
We have already identified landowners within the project areas who have agreed to rent us land that will be used to grow seedlings. This stage will include all activities related to nursery development such as nursery construction,  seed sourcing, seedbed preparation, sowing, potting, pricking out, watering, weeding, root pruning, etc. 
We plan to have three nurseries in three sites (sectors) and we will use the land for which we have agreements with landowners (see documentation explaining the project area's land tenure system, File name: Landowners commitments + copies of land documents). Half of the number of seedlings required to plant the target number of trees will be grown in 2024 and another half in 2025.  Nursery managers and farmer groups will get technical training related to nursery establishment and management practices. 
As mentioned in other sections of the proposal, community members will be trained and offered jobs to carry out these activities. We will also train the groups on how to make compost which will be used during the tree planting stage.

Stage 4: Site preparation (Aug  2024 and Aug 2025)
This stage will involve primarily digging holes and adding fertilizer to the holes.

Stage 5: Tree planting (September 2024 -  Dec 2025). 
This stage will involve all activities related to planting (seedling distribution to the farmers, planting of trees in farmland, and practical training related to agroforestry practices. Considering the rainfall pattern, the tree planting stage is planned between September and October, which corresponds to the short rainy season in Rwanda. 

Stage 6: Tree maintenance (From October 2024 to the end of the project)
This will involve all activities related to tree care and tree management. These are continuous activities until the harvest of tree products or the tree itself. This stage will also involve the replacement of dead trees 
This stage will involve activities such as weeding to prevent competition for water and nutrients. Trees may need regular pruning. Farmers will be trained in sustainable harvesting of a multitude of primary and secondary tree products while ensuring proper care for the trees to sustain long-term productivity.

Stage 7: Monitoring and Evaluation (Jan 2024 to the end of the project)
This stage will involve all activities related to monitoring, evaluation, and reporting.  The M&E team will work closely with the project manager to gather data and relevant information on the progress of the project, which will help us in timely reporting. The team will also help in identifying any issues arising during the project implementation. These issues and actions taken to resolve them will be communicated in a timely manner and discussed with WRI. The M&E team will be also supported by an external contractor, who will be hired to support us with some aspects required in reporting such as Field Monitoring and Remote Sensing. The contractor will advise us on how to draw geospatial polygons, how to use satellite data, etc.",approved,

The project's main activities include seedlings production, tree planting , community involvement, and maintenance which are expected to be carried out from January 2024 to December 2025
Seedling Production:
Since January 2024, the seedlings production phase has involved a series of critical activities. This includes the identification and construction of the nursery, sourcing/ requisitioning of seeds and planting materials, seed  sowing, evaluation of seed germination, grafting of some fruits trees and the routine nursery maintenance activities. This phase serves as the foundation for the subsequent planting activities, ensuring the availability of healthy and robust seedlings.
Planting Activities:
The timeline from January to December 2025 is allocated for various preparatory tasks, including site identification, site validation, and mapping the site. Community mobilization efforts will run simultaneously, fostering local engagement and support.
Further activities during this period encompass the pegging of planted holes, seedlings transportation, and planting. We will also assess the Species preference  and site selection and other activities including, weeding, beating up, and maintenance will also be done. The planting activities are scheduled to commence in April for some species 
Community involvement
The community, particularly those whose land parcels fall into the mapped landscape will be grouped into landscape community and form the assembly of farmers.

 The engagement extends to the active participation of the community in restoration works, emphasizing the collaborative nature of our approach. To guarantee the impact of our efforts, we prioritize training landscape committees and block leaders in restoration techniques. Additionally, the incorporation of project activities into district performance contracts and the signing of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with the district will give assurance of sustainability of the project achievement. Apart from the committee's leaders who will be trained to follow the restoration activities, The project will recruit both skilled and non-skilled laborers, permanent and casual following Rwanda Labor law without any form of discrimination to help in project implementation.

Tree and site maintenance.

Tree and site maintenance activities are integrated into the project's timeline for years 2024 to 2029. In the first two years, maintenance is a crucial aspect since the establishment of the nursery, we will maintain different aspects to keep the health of our seedlings, focusing on routine care such as watering, pest control, and inspections. The nursery site will be maintained by using protective materials like shade nets to prevent and defend the nursery from external threats like pests and diseases.
In subsequent years following nursery activities (2024-2029), ongoing maintenance efforts include periodic inspections, additional care, and rehabilitation if needed. In Planting Activities, we will Implement maintenance activities such as weeding, beating up, and regular inspections to secure the long-term success of the planted trees. During planting season which will start in April 2024, the site to be planted will be well identified and polygons will be created to localize the restoration area. Pegging and holes digging will be monitored and Planted trees will be maintained in the field by the local communities together with the trained elected committees to assist them in caring for the trees.
Monitoring and reporting.

Monitoring and reporting are integral to the project's success. In the initial year, January 2024 marks the first baseline assessment and monitoring of the seedling production phase and nursery establishments, site identification and community mobilization. These activities will be reported to TerraFund through its comprehensive biannual Terramatch reports starting in June 2024. In December 2024 another report will be submitted to TerraMach for the progress of plant activities. As an organization, we have a monthly report that tracks the progress of the activities, and this report will help us to make the Terra Match report for six months.",approved,

Talmond shall therefore conduct the following activities between January 2024 and 2029.

1.	January 2024: Project onboarding and layout of implementation plan.
2.	February -March 2024: Training of project farmers on site selection and land clearing in readiness for planting. In all, we expect to train 492 farmers across 54 communities in the Eastern, Ahafo and Volta regions.
3.	April 2024: Training of farmers on planting and biochar production. Biochar is good for providing the tree seedling with the ground to adapt to the soil. Biochar helps in the survival of seedlings. At Talmond level, we produce biochar from the shells of the tropical almond nuts or husks. Talmond shall train all our farmers to produce their own organic biochar which will be used during planting. This will be in addition to what Talmond shall support the farmers with.
4.	Mid-April-July 2024: Planting of tropical almond seedlings by farmers. This is the time that rainfall is highest so can provide the seedlings enough moisture to survive. Planting will be done annually in one window in the major season occurring between April to July 2024. The project shall support farmers with the planting according to recommended formats.
5.	July – Dec. 2024: Mapping of farms, profiling of the selected farmers and soil testing of farm lands under restoration. The mapping of the farms is to produce the necessary polygon for all farms under the project. The profiling of the farmers is to establish the necessary baseline for the farmers before the project which will serve as a good ground for evaluating the progress of the project in 2029. 
6.	Jan. 2025-Dec. 2025: Quarterly monitoring on survival rates of planted seedlings. This is the stage of monitoring the progress of the restoration project as well as documenting lessons for future programs. The monitoring plan will detail out the designated periods for monitoring.
7.	Jan. 2026 – Dec. 2026: Bi-annual monitoring of survival and growth rates of planted trees across all project regions.
8.	Jan. 2027 – Dec. 2029: Bi-annual monitoring of tree growth rates and forest cover levels of restored lands under project. This also marks the period of harvesting, processing and supply of tropical almonds to Talmond. This stage is an important aspect of the project because it is here that the project can determine the social and financial benefit of the project to the farmers and Talmond. The use of the tropical almond in this restoration is specific so that the fruits can be processed and sold to Talmond. 
9.	Jan. -Dec. 2029: This is the stage when the project shall consciously evaluate the project contribution to forest cover, biodiversity life, air quality, water storage, soil health, farmer and family livelihoods and wellbeing, job creation and general impact of the project.",approved,

The activities include the following; 

•	Identification of restoration and nursery sites and selection of tree/shrub species  
•	Establishment of tree nursery sites
•	Cultivation of native (and few exotic species like Grevilia robusta) tree seedlings
•	Plantation of tree seedlings on degraded forest lands 
•	Management and recording of tree growth this include beating up 

Based on an approval of the project the first year will be spent on preparatory activities like community consultation, site preparation, seedling raising, capacity building and plantation of some species which have short nursery life.

The second year will be for plantation of more seedlings and followed by management of the earlier year plantation and beating up. In the third through the fifth year will be mainly on planting, growing, tending (including beating up) and support in economic activities from incorporation fruits and spices in the agroforestry systems.  In the fifth year the number of seedlings to be planted and areas managed through assisted natural regenerations will increase progressively based on experiences of earlier undertakings. In the fourth- and fifth-year experience exchange with interested groups will be undertaken. We will assist the formation of local groups which will be involved in strengthening the community capacity in the production and marketing of various natural resources/forest-based products. In general, every year there will be plantation of trees in addition of the management of formerly planted trees and shrubs.

Community Mobilization (February 2024) - this will include holding sensitization meetings within the landscape with an aim of identifying farmers to be included in the project implementation. WWF-K having worked in the landscape in the past, has the knowledge on the strategic areas where such meetings will be conducted with maximum effectiveness. 

Site/Beneficiaries Mapping (Feb - March 2024) - this will partly run concurrently with the community mobilization phase of the project. Once farmers are identified during the mobilization meetings, their available farms for tree growing will be mapped (size & Geo-location) and registered for consideration in the project implementation. As a way of increasing community ownership, WWF-Kenya will train and
facilitate young people to assist with mapping of the beneficiaries within their own communities. This has always proved to be very successful in the past WWF-Kenya interventions.

Sites preparation (March/April & Sept/Oct of each planting year i.e. 2024 & 2025) - this will be done in phases depending on the number of seedlings to be planted in each rainy season. Farmers identified for planting in each season will be mobilized to prepare the land one month before planting. Guidance in terms of spacing and species selection will be offered to the farmers during the site preparation phase.

Seedlings procurement (March & August of each planting year i.e. 2024 & 2025) - this will allow for adequate preparation (including hardening off and transportation to site) of the seedlings for planting in each of the seasons. To address both benefits of seedlings
provenance (site suitability) and communities benefiting (increasing ownership), WWF-K will procure seedlings from
existing community tree nurseries. However, all quality checks for the seedlings to be planted will be guaranteed through collaboration with KFS personnel on the ground.

Planting (April/May & Oct/Nov of each planting year) - weather conditions held constant; the target is to plant double as many seedlings during the long rains (April/May) as compared to short rains (Oct/Nov). Seedlings will be supplied to each farmer based on the size of his/her identified and mapped farm as well as agreed restoration approach (woodlot/inter-cropping). To ensure high survival rates,
supervision will be done by the project team (assisted by community facilitators) to ensure that farmers plant the seedlings immediately after moisture build-up after the onset of the rains. To ensure equity, planting will be distributed equitably in all the identified planting jurisdictions within the 4 planting seasons - unless this is dictated otherwise by an externality such as uneven rainfall distribution.

Maintenance (planting to 6th year after planting) - this will be a joint undertaking between the farmer beneficiary and WWF-K. The farmer will agree to abide by all measures agreed during mobilization and identification phase (including weeding and protection) while WWF-K will continue offering the required advisory and capacity building services to the farmer through a designated project officer.

Monitoring (planting to 6th year after planting) - WWF-K monitoring and evaluation team will support this function throughout the project implementation phase. This will involve such sub-activities as survival counts, growth patterns, reporting and sharing of best practices.",approved,
