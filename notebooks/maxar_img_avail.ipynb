    "#### Workflow:\n",
    "1. Pull info on project characteristics for the entire portfolio using the TerraMatch API\n",
    "    - Repo/notebook: terrafund-portfolio-analysis/tm-api.ipynb\n",
    "    - Input: list of TerraFund project IDs\n",
    "    - Output: csv of all project features\n",
    "2. Using the TM API csv, pull Maxar metadata\n",
    "    - Repo/notebook: maxar-tools/decision-tree-metadata.ipynb and maxar-tools/src/decision_tree.py (? may need to change b/c of my additions to the acquire_metadata function)\n",
    "    - Input: csv of project features\n",
    "    - Output: csv of maxar metadata\n",
    "3. Calculate the percent area of each project with available Maxar imagery\n",
    "    - Repo/notebook: terrafund-portfolio-analysis/maxar-img-avail.ipynb and terrafund-portfolio-analysis/src/image_coverage.py\n",
    "    - Input: csv of maxar metadata and csv of TM project features\n",
    "    - Output: csv of project features and percent imagery coverage, csv of percent imagery coverage aggregated to project level, csv of polygons with low imagery coverage\n",
    "4. Identify projects with highest imagery coverage to use for the RS image availability simulation"
